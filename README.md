# MICCAI 2021 FLARE Challenge:
Fast and Low GPU memory Abdominal oRgan sEgmentation

Abdominal organ segmentation plays an important role in clinical practice, and to some extent, it seems to be a solved problem because the state-of-the-art methods have achieved inter-observer performance in several benchmark datasets. However, most of the existing abdominal datasets only contain single-center, single-phase, single-vendor, or single-disease cases, and it is unclear whether the excellent performance can be generalized on more diverse datasets. Moreover, many SOTA methods use model ensembles to boost performance, but these solutions usually have a large model size and cost extensive computational resources, which are impractical to be deployed in clinical practice.
